  All this does is play music in your browser using the Web SDK


  <script>
    /*
    *
    * READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE COMPLETING THE INSTRUCTIONS
    *
    * A  demo to see if we can play a song from the api in our app using
    * ionic (a framework that allows for development on multiple platforms)
    * Here is a link to more that can be done with the api https://developer.spotify.com/console/
    * (We will use the api to load in all the account information etc.)
    * Here is a link to the ionic framework https://ionicframework.com
    *
    * To run this code you are going to need to install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/
    *
    * After installing node.js install ionic by using this command in your terminal.  npm install -g ionic
    *
    * Next go in to the directory that you want to start your project in and use the command. ionic start MyIonicProject blank
    * You may need to click enter a few times to finish loading in the project (it will ask you some questions
    * just click enter)
    *
    * Go into your project folder and look into the src folder and find the index.html folder and open it
    *
    * Delete everything in the index.html. Copy everything from here into the index.html file
    *
    * To run this you are going to want to make sure you are in your project folder, in this case it will be called MyIonicProject
    *
    * use the command. ionic serve
    *
    * After it runs a link will show up that looks something like this http://localhost:8100
    * (the numbers might not be exactly the same). go to that link and music should start playing if everything was configured correctly
    *
    *
    * IMPORTANT: make sure you add a token at line 65ish. It explains how to get a token there. Also I'm pretty sure a
    * premium account is needed to play the music. let me know if something doesn't make sense or something doesnt work
    * I recommend using a code editor like Visual Studios or WebStorm.
    *
